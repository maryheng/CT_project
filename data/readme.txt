Given:

Random distribution of flags:
- flags_r1.csv. 300 flags. points range from 1 to 10, random distribution 
- flags_r2.csv. 230 flags. points range from 1 to 5,  random distribution
- flags_r3.csv. 300 flags. points range from 1 to 10, with 80% between 1 and 5, 20% between 5 and 10

Clustered distribution of flags: 
- flags_c1.csv. 300 flags. points range from 1 to 10, random distribution 
- flags_c2.csv. 230 flags. points range from 1 to 5,  random distribution
- flags_c3.csv. 300 flags. points range from 1 to 10, with 80% between 1 and 5, 20% between 5 and 10

Mixed distribution (clustered/random) of flags:
- flags_m1.csv. 300 flags. points range from 1 to 10, random distribution 
- flags_m2.csv. 330 flags. points range from 1 to 5,  random distribution
- flags_m3.csv. 300 flags. points range from 1 to 10, with 80% between 1 and 5, 20% between 5 and 10

Do create your own CSV files if you want more data samples. 
Your algorithm should work well with different flags files.
